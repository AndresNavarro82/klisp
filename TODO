* refactor:
** double check combiner names to be verbs 
   (e.g. add get- where appropriate)
** split kghelpers in appropriate parts
  (e.g. create knumber.h knumber.c and move there kfinitep, kintegerp, etc
  from kgnumbers)
** use some convention for ground operative underlaying function names
   maybe add "kgop_"
** use a better convention for continuation underlaying function names
** try to use krooted_vars_push more to save some lines and avoid
   clutter (e.g. when creating continuations)
** Study differrent c interfaces (maybe a stack like in lua would be
   better than dealing with gc push/pop)
** eliminate all remaining char * arguments where not needed
** check if all inline functions need to be inline
** standarize either int32_t (now used in lists) or uint32_t (now used
   in strings, vectors and bytevectors) for sizes (and maybe use a 
   typedef like lua)
* fix:
** fix/test the tty detection in the interpreter
** fix char-ready? and u8-ready? (r7rs)
** eliminate kread_ignore_whitespace_and_commonts_from_port,
  replace for a boolean flag to tell read to reset source info
  after first token read.
* documentation
** fix some inconsistencies between the man page and the interpreter
   behaviour.
** update the manual with the current features
** add a section to the manual with the interpreter usage
* operatives: 
** $case (r7rs)
** $case-lambda (r7rs)
** $case-vau (r7rs)
** $named-let (r7rs)
** $do (r7rs)
** $define-record-type (r7rs)
* applicatives: 
** number->string (r7rs)
** string->number (r7rs)
* reader
** symbol escapes (r7rs)
** string escapes (r7rs)
** char escapes (r7rs)
* other
** optional argument to member? (r7rs)
** optional argument to assoc (r7rs)
** some simplified error guarding (r7rs)
** restarts (r7rs)
** add restart support to the repl/interpreter (r7rs)
** simple modules (something inspired in r7rs) (r7rs)
** add modules support to the interpreter (r7rs)
** eager comprehensions (at least for check.k) see SRFIs 42 and 78
   (srfi)
