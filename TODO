* Release 0.3
** Test
*** Windows
    - build (clean)
*** MacOS
    - build
    - test cases
** Makefile
*** Windows
    - problem with clean
* Release 0.4+
** refactor:
*** clean stand alone interpreter
*** double check combiner names to be verbs 
    - add get- where appropriate
*** split kghelpers 
    - knumber.h knumber.c (kfinitep, kintegerp, etc)
*** naming convention for ground operative functions
    - maybe add "kgop_"
    - use 'P' instead of 'p' for ground predicates
*** naming convention for continuation functions
    - intead of "do_"
*** use krooted_vars_push more to avoid clutter
    - when creating continuations
*** Study differrent c interfaces 
    - maybe a stack like in lua would be better than dealing with gc guarding
*** eliminate all remaining char * arguments where not needed
    - typep
*** remove most of inline declarations
*** standarize size type
    - do a typedef
    - currently
      - int32_t (used in lists)
      - uint32_t (used in strings, vectors and bytevectors)
*** add static qualifiers (especially in all kg*.c files)
*** add const qualifiers where sensible
** fix:
- fix char-ready? and u8-ready? (r7rs)
    - Probably need a thread per port
** reader/writer
- syntax support for complex numbers (Kernel report)
- unicode support
- add case sensitive option / compiler flag
*** add new external representations
- vectors
- bytevectors
- errors
- others(?)
** features
*** r7rs
- add optional arguments to all versions of fill!
- add optional arguments to all versions of copy
- read-bytevector & read-bytevector!
*** extra
- read lines (reads all lines and returns a list of them)
- read list (like what is used for load)
** library
*** some simplified error guarding (r7rs)
*** $case (r7rs)
*** $case-lambda + $case-vau (r7rs)
*** $named-let + $do (r7rs)
*** $define-record-type (r7rs)
*** eager comprehensions (at least for check.k) see SRFIs 42 and 78 (srfi)
*** restarts (r7rs/common lisp)
*** check.k as a module
** webpage
- Have Maria Sol draw a simple logo
** other
*** add restart support to the repl/interpreter (r7rs)
*** complex numbers (Kernel report)
*** interval arithmetic (Kernel report)
** reduce binary size 
*** currently (2011/12/05) is 3megs
  - most of it from kg*.o
  - klisp_assert:
    - almost 1 meg comes from klisp_asserts
    - adds considerably to the compilation time
    - add a flag to enable assertions
      - and disable it by default
      - fix warnings when assertions are turned off 
	- unitialized uses
	- unused variables
  - debugging symbols:
    - 1 meg and a half comes from debugging symbols
    - adds to the compilation time
    - add a flag 
      - maybe the same as for asserts
      - maybe another one
      - disable it by default
  - Even after disabling these two, the size is 500k
  - Continue investigating and try to make it lower

** documentation
*** info/html manual
  - xrefs
  - Clean up the structure of the documentation
  - a little on the indexes
  - add sections for general concepts (tail context, dynamic extent, etc)
  - find a way to inline function documentation in the c source code 
    (check to see how emacs does this for elisp)
*** README
  - Add README files to all directories
*** man page
  - change man page to mandoc format
