@deffn Applicative file-exists? (file-exists? string)
  @code{string} should be the name/path for a file.

  Predicate @code{file-exists?} checks to see if a file named
@code{string} exists.

  SOURCE NOTE: this is missing from Kernel, it is taken from r7rs Scheme.
@end deffn

@deffn Applicative delete-file (delete-file string)
  @code{string} should be the name/path for an existing file.

  Applicative @code{delete-file} deletes the file named @code{string}.
If it doesn't exists or can't be deleted, an error is signaled. The
result returned by @code{delete-file} is inert. 

  SOURCE NOTE: this is missing from Kernel, it is taken from r7rs Scheme.
@end deffn

@deffn Applicative rename-file (rename-file string1 string2)
  @code{string1} should be the name/path for an existing file,
@code{string2} should be the name/path for a non existing file.

  Applicative @code{rename-file} renames the file named @code{string1}
to @code{string2}. If the file doesn't exists or can't be renamed for
any reason, an error is signaled. The result returned by
@code{rename-file} is inert. 

  SOURCE NOTE: this is missing from Kernel AND Scheme, it is taken
from C, being quite similar to @code{delete-file}.
