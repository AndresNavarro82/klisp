<h2 class="chapter">1 Introduction</h2>

<p>klisp is an open source interpreter for the Kernel Programming
Language.  It aims at being comprehensive and robust as specified in
the <cite>Revised(-1) Report on the Kernel Programming Language</cite>, but
that probably won't happen for some time.  It is written in C99 under
the MIT license.  It draws heavily from the Lua interpreter source
code &amp; file structure.  It uses the IMath library for arbitrary sized
integers and rationals.

   <p>The Kernel programming language is a statically scoped and properly
tail-recursive dialect of Lisp, descended from Scheme.  It is designed
to be simpler and more general than Scheme, with an exceptionally
clear, simple, and versatile semantics, only one way to form compound
expressions, and no inessential restrictions on the power of that one
compound form.  Imperative, functional, and message-passing programming
styles (to name a few) may be conveniently expressed in Kernel.

   <p>An important property of Kernel is that all manipulable entities in
Kernel are first-class objects.  In particular, Kernel has no
second-class combiners; instead, the roles of special forms and macros
are subsumed by operatives, which are first-class, statically scoped
combiners that act directly on their unevaluated operands.  Kernel
also has a second type of combiners, applicatives, which act on their
evalu- ated arguments.  Applicatives are roughly equivalent to Scheme
procedures.  However, an applicative is nothing more than a wrapper to
induce operand evaluation, around an underlying operative (or, in
principle, around another applicative, though that isnâ€™t usually
done); applicatives themselves are mere facilitators to computation.

   <p>klisp is developed by Andres Navarro, a Computer Science
undergraduate at Buenos Aires University (UBA).  You can reach him at
<a href="mailto:canavarro82@gmail.com">canavarro82@gmail.com</a>. Significant contributions are being
done by Oto Havle, his fork is at

   <p>This manual describes klisp version 0.3, presuming some familiarity
with the Lisp family of languages in general, and with the Kernel
Programming Language in particular.  There are frequent references to
the Kernel Programming Language Report.  Unlike in the report, no
rationale is provided for any feature, only a description of the
implemented functionality.

   <p>This is edition 0.3.
