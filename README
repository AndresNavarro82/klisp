README for klisp 0.1

* What is klisp?
  --------------
  klisp is an open source interpreter for the Kernel Programming
  Language. It aims at being comprehensive and robust as specified in
  the "Revised(-1) Report on the Kernel Programming Language", but
  that probably won't happen for some time. It is written in C99 under
  the MIT license. It draws heavily from the Lua interpreter source
  code & file structure.

* What is the Kernel Programming Language?
  ----------------------------------------
  Kernel is a conservative, Scheme-like dialect of Lisp in which
  everything is a first-class object. It was created by John N. Shutt.
  You can read all about it at

* Availability
  ------------
  klisp is freely available for both academic and commercial purposes.
  See COPYRIGHT for details.
  klisp can be downloaded at
  http://www.bitbucket.org/AndresNavarro/klisp


* Installation
  ------------
  klisp is implemented in C99, with some gcc extensions for packing
  and alignment. It was developed and tested in x86 under Linux. In
  time it will be written so as to be compiled under many different
  platforms, but right now the author's efforts are directed towards
  implementing functionality.

* Origin
  ------
  klisp is developed by Andres Navarro, a Computer Science
  undergraduate at Buenos Aires University (UBA). You can reach him at
