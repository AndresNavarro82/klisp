README for klisp 0.3

* What is klisp?
  --------------
  klisp is an open source interpreter for the Kernel Programming
  Language. It aims at being comprehensive and robust as specified in
  the "Revised(-1) Report on the Kernel Programming Language", but
  that probably won't happen for some time. It is written in C99 under
  the MIT license. It draws heavily from the Lua interpreter source
  code & file structure. It uses the IMath library for arbitrary sized
  integers and rationals. You can check the webpage at http://klisp.org
  and the discussion group at http://groups.google.com/group/klisp

* What is the Kernel Programming Language?
  ---------------------------------------- 
  Kernel is a Scheme-like dialect of Lisp in which everything is a
  first-class object. It features first class environments and
  statically scoped fexprs (called operatives). It was created by 
  John N. Shutt.  You can read all about it at
  http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~jshutt/kernel.html

* Availability
  ------------
  klisp is freely available for both academic and commercial purposes.
  See COPYRIGHT for details.
  klisp can be downloaded from http://klisp.org or from 
  https://bitbucket.org/AndresNavarro/klisp

* Installation
  ------------
  klisp is implemented in C99, with some gcc extensions for packing
  and alignment. It was developed and tested in x86 under Linux. It
  should compile fine under other Operating Systems using gcc
  (MinGW in Windows also works). As time goes by, platform specific
  code will have to be added (e.g. for char-ready?). Effort will be
  directed to minimize the ammount of platform specific code, and 
  testing will be conducted at least on Linux and Windows (the systems
  I have access to at the moment).

* Origin
  ------
  klisp is developed by Andres Navarro, a Computer Science
  undergraduate at Buenos Aires University (UBA). You can reach him at
  <canavarro82@gmail.com>.
  Significant contributions are being made by Oto Havle in his fork
  over at https://bitbucket.org/havleoto/klisp
