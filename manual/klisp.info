1 Introduction
**************

klisp is an open source interpreter for the Kernel Programming
Language. It aims at being comprehensive and robust as specified in
the "Revised(-1) Report on the Kernel Programming Language", but that
probably won't happen for some time. It is written in C99 under the
MIT license. It draws heavily from the Lua interpreter source code &
file structure. It uses the IMath library for arbitrary sized
integers and rationals.

   Kernel is a conservative, Scheme-like dialect of Lisp in which
everything is a first-class object. It was created by John N. Shutt.
You can read all about it at http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~jshutt/kernel.html

   klisp is freely available for both academic and commercial
purposes.  See LICENSE for details. it can be downloaded at
http://www.bitbucket.org/AndresNavarro/klisp

   klisp is developed by Andres Navarro, a Computer Science
undergraduate at Buenos Aires University (UBA). You can reach him at
<canavarro82@gmail.com>.

   This manual describes klisp version 0.1, presuming some familiarity
with the Lisp family of languages in general, and with the Kernel
Programming Language in particular. There are frequent references to
the Kernel Programming Language Report. Unlike in the report, no
rationale is provided for any feature, only a description of the
implemented functionality.

   This is edition 0.1.
