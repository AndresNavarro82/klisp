1 Introduction
**************

klisp is an open source interpreter for the Kernel Programming
Language. It aims at being comprehensive and robust as specified in
the `Revised(-1) Report on the Kernel Programming Language', but that
probably won't happen for some time. It is written in C99 under the
MIT license. It draws heavily from the Lua interpreter source code &
file structure. It uses the IMath library for arbitrary sized
integers and rationals.

   The Kernel programming language is a statically scoped and properly
tail-recursive dialect of Lisp, descended from Scheme. It is designed
to be simpler and more general than Scheme, with an exceptionally
clear, simple, and versatile semantics, only one way to form compound
expressions, and no inessential restrictions on the power of that one
compound form. Imperative, functional, and message-passing programming
styles (to name a few) may be conveniently expressed in Kernel.

   An important property of Kernel is that all manipulable entities in
Kernel are first-class objects. In particular, Kernel has no
second-class combiners; instead, the roles of special forms and macros
are subsumed by operatives, which are first-class, statically scoped
combiners that act directly on their unevaluated operands. Kernel
also has a second type of combiners, applicatives, which act on their
evalu- ated arguments. Applicatives are roughly equivalent to Scheme
procedures. However, an applicative is nothing more than a wrapper to
induce operand evaluation, around an underlying operative (or, in
principle, around another applicative, though that isnâ€™t usually
done); applicatives themselves are mere facilitators to computation.

   klisp is freely available for both academic and commercial
purposes.  See LICENSE for details. it can be downloaded at

   klisp is developed by Andres Navarro, a Computer Science
undergraduate at Buenos Aires University (UBA). You can reach him at
<canavarro82@gmail.com>.

   This manual describes klisp version 0.1, presuming some familiarity
with the Lisp family of languages in general, and with the Kernel
Programming Language in particular. There are frequent references to
the Kernel Programming Language Report. Unlike in the report, no
rationale is provided for any feature, only a description of the
implemented functionality.

   This is edition 0.1.

1.1 Caveats
===========

This is the first draft of this manual. It will be incomplete for
some time. It will also evolve, together with klisp and the Kernel
Programming Language, both of which, right now, are in a quite fluid
state.

   The main reference on Kernel is the preliminary report:
`Revised(-1) Report on the Kernel Programming Language'. Some
sections of the report are still incomplete, so both klisp and this
manual will use specifications from other languages in these sections,
trying to follow the Kernel spirit. These instances will be documented
throughout the manual.

   Please mail comments and corrections to <canavarro82@gmail.com>.

1.2 Kernel History
==================

The Kernel Programming Language is a work in progress. It is being
developed by John N. Shutt, Ph.D, who created it while studying at the
Worcester Polytechnic Institute (I think about 2002, or so... ASK). It
is descended from scheme, with the idea that all objects should be
first class values. In particular, Kernel replaces macros with
operatives (kinda like statically scoped fexprs and fsubrs) and has
first class environments. Kernel also has the notion of encapsulated
objects which limits the ammount of information an implementation can
share with a Kernel program (e.g. There is no way in Kernel to get the
parents or a complete list of bindings of an environment object).

   The main reference on Kernel is the preliminary report:
`Revised(-1) Report on the Kernel Programming Language'. Some
sections of the report are still incomplete, so both klisp and this
manual will use specifications from other languages in these sections,
trying to follow the Kernel spirit. These instances will be documented
throughout the manual.

   You can read all about Kernel at John's homepage at WPI
`http://www.cs.wpi.edu/~jshutt/', including the preliminary report on
the language and his doctoral dissertation which gives a theorethical
frame for fexprs. You can contact him at <jshutt@cs.wpi.edu>.

1.3 Conventions
===============

This section explains the notational conventions that are used in this
manual. You may want to skip this section and refer back to it later.

* Menu:

* Some Terms::               Explanation of terms we use in this manual.
* Evaluation Notation::      The format we use for examples of evaluation.
* Printing Notation::        The format we use for examples that print output.
* Error Messages::           The format we use for examples of errors.
* Format of Descriptions::   Notation for describing functions, variables, etc.


File: klisp,  Node: Some Terms,  Next: Evaluation Notation,  Prev: Conventions,  Up: Conventions

1.3.1 Some Terms
----------------

Throughout this manual, the phrases "the Kernel reader" and "the
Kernel printer" are used to refer to those routines in Lisp that
convert textual representations of Kernel objects into actual
objects, and vice versa. XXX Printed Representation XXX, for more
details. You, the person reading this manual, are assumed to be "the
programmer" or "the user".

   Examples of Kernel code appear in this font or form: `(list 1 2
3)'. Names that represent arguments or metasyntactic variables appear
in this font or form: FIRST-NUMBER.


File: klisp,  Node: Evaluation Notation,  Next: Printing Notation,  Prev: Some Terms,  Up: Conventions

1.3.2 Evaluation Notation
-------------------------

When you evaluate a piece of Kernel code, it produces a result. In the
examples in this manual, this is indicated with `=>':

     (car (cons 1 2))
          => 1

You can read this as "`(car (cons 1 2))' evaluates to 1".

   The semantics of a language feature are sometimes clarified, or
even defined, in its entry by specifying that two expressions are
equivalent. This is notated with `=='. For example, the semantics of
applicative list* can be defined by following equivalences:
     (list* arg1) == arg1
     (list* arg1 . more-args) == (cons arg1 (list* . more-args))

1.3.3 Printing Notation
-----------------------

Many of the examples in this manual print text when they are
evaluated. In examples that print text, the printed text is indicated
with `-|'. The value returned by evaluating the form (here `#t')
follows on a separate line.

     ($sequence (write 1) (write 2) #t)
          -| 1
          -| 2
          => #t

1.3.4 Error Messages
--------------------

Some examples cause errors to be signaled. The report doesn't specify
what objects are passed to the error continuation, but in klisp,
objects passed to the error continuation are encapsulated error
objects that have at least a message and possibly some additional
objects and context informations (such as source code location). In
the examples, the error message is shown on a line starting with
`error-->'.

     (+ 23 #t)
     error--> Wrong type argument: (expected number) (#t)

1.3.5 Format of Descriptions
----------------------------

Applicatives, operatives, and other objects are described in this
manual in a uniform format. The first line of a description contains
the name of the item followed by its operands or arguments, if any.
The category--operative, applicative, or whatever--appears at the
beginning of the line.  The description follows on succeeding lines,
sometimes with examples.

* A Sample Applicative Description::


File: klisp,  Node: A Sample Applicative Description,  Prev: Format of Descriptions,  Up: Format of Descriptions

1.3.5.1 A Sample Applicative Description
........................................

In an applicative description, the name of the applicative being
described appears first. It is followed on the same line by a list of
arguments.  The names used for the arguments are also used in the
body of the description.

   Here is a description of an imaginary applicative `foo':

 -- Applicative: (foo integer1 integer2 . rest)
     The applicative `foo' subtracts INTEGER1 from INTEGER2, then
     adds all the rest of the arguments to the result.

          (foo 1 5 3 9)
               => 16

     More generally,

          (foo W X Y...)
          ==
          (+ (- X W) Y...)

   Any parameter whose name contains the name of a type (e.g.,
INTEGER, INTEGER1 or CONTINUATION) is expected to be of that type. A
plural of a type (such as NUMBERS) often means a list of objects of
that type. Parameters named OBJECT may be of any type.  (XXX Types of
Lisp Object XXX, for a list of Kernel object types.)  Parameters with
other sorts of names are discussed specifically in the description of
the combiner. In some sections, features common to parameters of
several combiners are described at the beginning.

   Operative descriptions have the same format, but the word
`Applicative' is  replaced by `Operative', and `Argument' is replaced
by `Operand'. Also Operatives always have an environment parameter
(that can be #ignore or a symbol).
